### The Birthmark Standard Foundation

Building open-source infrastructure for cryptographic proof that photos came from real cameras, not AI generation. As Executive Director & Founder, I lead the development of hardware-backed authentication using camera sensor fingerprints and a consortium blockchain maintained by mission-driven journalism organizations—permanent, verifiable proof that specific camera hardware captured specific images. Privacy-by-design.

#### Current Status: Phase 1
Building proof-of-concept with Raspberry Pi + camera hardware to validate the complete cryptographic pipeline.

**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Substrate blockchain

#### Seeking
* **Coalition Partners:** Journalism organizations, fact-checking groups (e.g., RSF, NPPA, IFCN, CPJ, Bellingcat)
* **Funding:** Assembling grant applications to Mozilla, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, Knight Foundation
