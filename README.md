# Hi there 👋

## Samuel C. Ryan | Founder & Principal Engineer, The Birthmark Standard Foundation

Building open-source infrastructure for cryptographic proof that photos came from real cameras, not AI generation.

### 🔐 The Problem We Solve

Trust in photographic evidence is collapsing. Without reliable ways to distinguish real photos from AI-generated fakes, journalism loses credibility and misinformation spreads unchecked.

**Our Solution:** Hardware-backed authentication using camera sensor fingerprints + consortium blockchain maintained by mission-driven journalism organizations. Permanent, verifiable proof that specific camera hardware captured specific images. Privacy-by-design.

### 🚀 Current Status: Phase 1

Building proof-of-concept with Raspberry Pi + camera hardware to validate the complete cryptographic pipeline.

**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Cosmos SDK blockchain, TPM/Secure Element

### 🤝 Seeking

* **Coalition Partners:** Journalism organizations, fact-checking groups (e.g., RSF, NPPA, IFCN, CPJ, Bellingcat)
* **Funding:** Assembling grant applications to Mozilla, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, Knight Foundation

### 🔬 Background

* M.Sc. Semiconductor Process Engineering
* 15+ years: energy storage (ESS), thermal imaging (FLIR), aerospace quality systems
