Hi there 👋

### Samuel C. Ryan | Building Digital Trust Infrastructure

I am currently leading the launch of the **Birthmark Protocol Foundation**, an open-source initiative dedicated to creating verifiable digital authentication infrastructure.

### 🔨 Current Work: The Birthmark Protocol

🔐 **Mission:** Combat the deepfake crisis by establishing a **Hardware-Backed Root of Trust** for digital media.

* **Technology:** We integrate a Secure Element (HWRoT) at the point of creation and record the hash to an **immutable public blockchain** (via zkRollup integration).
* **Status:** Building the **Phase I Proof-of-Concept (PoC)** to secure foundational grant funding.
* **Legal:** Protocol concepts are published as **prior art** to ensure perpetual public ownership and prevent corporate monopolization.
* **Join Us:** Actively seeking **contributors, partners, and advisors** to finalize the governance structure.
