**Founder & Executive Director, The Birthmark Standard Foundation**

Building open-source infrastructure to combat the cynicism that comes from the flood of AI-generated images.

## What I'm Building

**The Birthmark Standard** - Hardware-backed photo authentication proving images came from real cameras, not AI generation.

- **Camera fingerprints** as hardware roots of trust
- **Blockchain verification** operated by trustworthy mission-driven organizations (not corporations)
- **Privacy-by-design** architecture preventing surveillance
- **Metadata-independent** - survives social media sharing

## Current Phase

**Phase 1 Prototype** - Raspberry Pi + HQ Camera + TPM demonstrating complete cryptographic pipeline from sensor capture through blockchain verification.

**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Cosmos SDK, TPM/Secure Element, Cryptographic key rotation

## Background

- **M.Sc. Semiconductor Process Engineering** (University of Oregon)
- **15+ years systems engineering:** Energy storage (ESS Inc), thermal imaging (FLIR Systems), aerospace quality (AS9102 FAI)
- **Regulated industries expertise:** Where "move fast and break things" isn't acceptable

## Seeking

**Coalition Partners** - Journalism organizations, fact-checkers, press freedom advocates (NPPA, IFCN, CPJ, RSF, Bellingcat)

**Funding** - Grant applications in progress: Mozilla Foundation, Craig Newmark Philanthropies

**Technical Feedback** - Security researchers, cryptographers, privacy advocates
